Yet there James stood after emerging from his computer screen, James showed him unimaginable horrors and said one thing before running back through the computer, "I am the owner of Techlore, you are merely the face".

f70c5327 (DuskNotSolar 2021-08-31 16:35:12 +1000  8) "Huh?" 
f70c5327 (DuskNotSolar 2021-08-31 16:35:12 +1000  9) James then snapped his fingers and sent Platekoala to his pocket dimension of miscellaneous horrors. James then took over Platekoalas matrix account so no one would wonder about a thing.

50f7b8b1 (DuskNotSolar 2021-09-01 19:34:55 +1000 11) James' rage began to overflow. A leaked conversation showed that Henry was planning to ban James from matrix and discord with one shot with plans to stop him from making his way back into the community

James messaged Henry through one of his many puppet accounts with vague threats, James did this with hundreds of accounts, each account said the same message word for word. Henry was getting concerned and knew that  this was James' doing. It was time for the plan to be put in action.
